* There are 2 types of components.
    1. client components -> That are loaded on the client side (the user's browser)
    2. server components -> That are loaded on the server side (data center, backend)
        - after rendering the server components, a react server component (RSC) payload is sent to the client browser for rendering
            - This RCS contains: rendered results of the server components
            - placeholders for the client components

* NextJs uses server components by default
